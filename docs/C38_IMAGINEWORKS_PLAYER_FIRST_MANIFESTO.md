# C38 ImagineWorks: Player-First Dev Manifesto

> **We are gamers before we are developers.**  
> We know the heartbreak of a buggy launch, the sting of a half-finished game, and the insult of being asked to pay for the ending.  
> We remember being promised innovation and handed a live-service cash grab instead.  
> And we remember when art was for the people—not just for profit.

**So we made a vow—to build different.**

## Core Values:

**1. Players First. Always.**  
Your experience, your joy, your time—those come first. Everything else waits.

**2. If You Buy It, You Own It.**  
DRM-free. Modder-friendly. No license loopholes. Your game, your way.

**3. No Predatory Monetization.**  
No microtransactions. No loot boxes. No battle passes. No gambling systems disguised as “fun.”

**4. Free Content, Forever.**  
If it expands the story or improves the game, you won’t be paying extra. That’s our promise.

**5. Complete at Launch.**  
We will not ship half a vision. The game will be whole. Day one. No excuses.

**6. Modding Is Sacred.**  
You make it better, deeper—we celebrate you, not shut you down. Modders are part of our legacy.

**7. No Blockchain, NFT, or Crypto Bullsh*t.**  
We do *not* exploit our players.  
No pay-to-own “assets,” no speculative currencies, no artificial scarcity.  
Your immersion is not a marketplace.

**8. Respect the Player’s Time.**  
No grind walls. No daily login traps. No FOMO bait. Just real gameplay with purpose.

**9. Partners Must Align.**  
If you join us—publisher, platform, or partner—you honor this mission.  
No compromise. No negotiation.  
If you can’t respect the player, you’re not invited to the table.

## This is not a marketing statement. This is our covenant.

C38 ImagineWorks is here to **heal the industry—not hustle it.**  
If you ride with us, you ride with the players.  
And if not?

> *We wish you well, but we ain’t the endeavor you’re lookin’ for.*
