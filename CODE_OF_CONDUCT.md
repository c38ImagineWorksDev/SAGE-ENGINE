## ðŸ“Œ Our Vibe

This project is built on innovation, Black excellence, and fearless imagination. SAGE â€” the STYNTHREAD Advanced Game Engine â€” isnâ€™t just tech. Itâ€™s testimony. We move with purpose, community, and accountability. Youâ€™re in our space now. Act like it.

## ðŸ’¬ Expected Behavior

All contributors, collaborators, and community members are expected to:

- Speak and act with respect for everyone â€” regardless of race, gender identity, orientation, disability, background, or level of experience.
- Celebrate diversity in voice, skillset, and perspective.
- Help others learn â€” this is a teaching and learning space.
- Own your mistakes and give folks room to grow.
- Maintain a constructive, collaborative tone â€” this ain't corporate, but we ain't messy either.
- Communicate in English whenever possible to keep conversations accessible to the entire dev team.  
  _(Non-native speakers are always welcome â€” effort and clarity matter more than perfection.)_

## ðŸš« Unacceptable Behavior

We donâ€™t tolerate:

- Harassment of any kind â€” including slurs, bullying, microaggressions, or targeted attacks.
- Dismissing, talking over, or invalidating others â€” especially marginalized voices.
- Spam, self-promo without context, or hijacking threads.
- Gatekeeping â€” SAGE is for creators from all walks, not just industry insiders.

## ðŸ“£ Reporting Violations

If you see or experience behavior that violates this code:

- Reach out directly to the repo admin via GitHub or email: c38imagineworks@gmail.com
- We take every report seriously and address it with discretion, care, and urgency.

## ðŸ’¡ Consequences

We reserve the right to:

- Remove comments, commits, or pull requests that violate this Code.
- Ban repeat offenders or anyone creating a hostile environment.
- Escalate to platform moderation if necessary.

## ðŸ’Ž Final Note

This engine should not exist â€” but weâ€™re building it anyway. This community will grow. The stakes will get higher. So let this be the foundation: _Respect the work. Respect the people. Respect the vision._

Welcome to the thread.
