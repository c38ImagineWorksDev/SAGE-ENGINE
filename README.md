# STYNTHREAD ADVANCED GAME ENGINE (SAGE)

**"This engine should not exist... but I'm gonna build it anyway."**

SAGE (STYNTHREAD Advanced Game Engine) is a next-generation game engine currently in active development by **C38 ImagineWorks**.

More than an engine‚ÄîSAGE is an act of reclamation, vision, and innovation. Built for devs who demand more from the systems they use, SAGE is being created from the ground up inside Unreal Engine 5 to redefine the meaning of *emotional consequence, memory-based logic,* and *player-driven immersion*.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Makes SAGE Different?

- **ThreadPrint Framework**  
  Every action leaves a mark. SAGE tracks emotional memory across player interactions, storing consequences like spiritual scars.

- **ThreadLore System**  
  Narrative memory becomes a living system that evolves based on what players *believe,* not just what they do.

- **Sensory AI**  
  Enemies don‚Äôt just react. They remember. They *adapt*. Your presence leaves an imprint.

- **Combat Rooted in Intention**  
  Inspired by FromSoftware, but layered with reactive storytelling and semi-autonomous combat logic systems.

- **Multiplatform Compatibility**  
  While in early stages, SAGE is being structured with long-term support for PC, handhelds, and MMO infrastructures in mind.
