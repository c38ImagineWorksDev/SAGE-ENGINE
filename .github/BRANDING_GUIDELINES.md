# Brand Representation & Usage Guidelines

The **SAGE Engine (STYNTHREAD Advanced Game Engine)** is an original, proprietary technology developed and owned by **C38 ImagineWorks**. This document outlines the terms for public use, mention, and representation of the SAGE brand.

---

## ✋ DO NOT:

- **Do NOT remix, redraw, recolor, distort, or edit the SAGE logo** in any way. That design is sacred.  
- **Do NOT use the name “SAGE” in your own engine, product, or brand** without **explicit written permission**.  
- **Do NOT associate SAGE with any NFT, blockchain, or AI-generated exploitative content**.  
- **Do NOT imply official support, affiliation, or partnership with C38 ImagineWorks** unless it's been signed and sealed.

*Violators will meet the Void.* And trust — we know how to code a reckoning.

---

## ✅ DO:

- **Credit SAGE properly** if your work was developed using the engine, with a tagline such as:  
  _“Built with the STYNTHREAD Advanced Game Engine (SAGE), by C38 ImagineWorks.”_

- **Contact us** for partnership, licensing, press kits, or visual asset requests:  
  `c38imagineworksdev@proton.me`

- Respect the thread. The weave is deep.

## Branding Is Sacred

SAGE is more than code. It’s a statement.  
Every glyph, every glitch, every thread was born with intention.  
So if you wanna rock with it, come correct.
