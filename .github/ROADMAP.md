# 🧵 SAGE Engine Roadmap

> "This engine should not exist. But we gon' build it anyway."

## 🚀 Overview
The **STYNTHREAD Advanced Game Engine (SAGE)** is a proprietary, narrative-reactive engine designed by **C38 ImagineWorks** to weave consequence into every layer of gameplay. Below is the public roadmap outlining projected development phases, major feature drops, and timelines *(subject to refinement as the project scales)*.

---

## 🗓️ PHASE ONE — Foundation *(Q2 2025)*
**Goal:** Lay the architectural backbone of SAGE within UE5 and establish version control, documentation, and internal pipeline.

- ✅ Create public GitHub repo with license, ToU, contribution guide  
- ✅ Define core philosophy and memory-reactive systems *(ThreadPrint)*  
- ✅ Build initial `ThreadMemoryComponent` and test logging blueprint  
- ✅ Set up modular documentation *(README, SECURITY, SUPPORT, etc.)*  
- 🔄 Start integrating `ThreadManager` logic into player actor  
- ⏳ Begin working on custom Editor widgets for visual debugging  
- 🛠️ **Tools:** GitHub, UE5, Blueprint/C++, Notion, Markdown

---

## 🗓️ PHASE TWO — Core Modules *(Q3 2025)*
**Goal:** Construct major SAGE subsystems with UI tools for interaction.

- ⏳ `ThreadSense` input parser *(triggers ThreadPrint logs)*  
- ⏳ `Syntaxbreaker` AI node recognition + pattern disruptor  
- ⏳ Reactive HUD prototype *(emotional memory visualization)*  
- ⏳ Save/Load memory state system w/ branching persistence  
- ⏳ Blueprint-first visual interface for dev teams  
- 🔐 Access control + dev-only editor permissions  
- 🛠️ **Tools:** UE5 Blueprints, Datatables, Slate UI, JSON

---

## 🗓️ PHASE THREE — Advanced Features *(Q4 2025)*
**Goal:** Push into high-level abstraction tools and expand emotional depth.

- ⏳ Layered consequence system *(Forgiveness Flags, Synaptic Echoes)*  
- ⏳ Player/NPC behavioral imprint mapping  
- ⏳ Emotional decay curve tracking  
- ⏳ Lattice Integration *(endgame deity code bindings)*  
- ⏳ `Threadweaver` Visual Debug Tool *(emotional heatmap overlay)*  

---

## 🗓️ PHASE FOUR — Ecosystem & Extensions *(Q1 2026)*
**Goal:** Finalize engine, introduce mod/dev support, and prepare showcase rollout.

- ⏳ Create Documentation Site *(GitHub Pages / Docusaurus)*  
- ⏳ Modding structure *(sandboxed runtime extensions)*  
- ⏳ Integration with Steam Workshop or SAGE Workshop  
- ⏳ Release alpha SDK for testing  
- ⏳ Launch first game built entirely in SAGE  

---

## 🗓️ LONG-TERM *(2026+)*
**Goal:** Position SAGE as the defining engine in emotionally intelligent development.

- 🌍 Host annual developer events *(ThreadJam)*  
- 🧠 Procedural narrative AI integration  
- 🎓 Indie tutorial pipeline + learning resources  
- 🤝 License to select partner studios *(terms apply)*
